# Introduction to Torch Tool

**Torch Tool** is a modular, explicit, and flexible toolkit designed to simplify and improve GPU/CPU device management, tensor conversions, and mixed precision training workflows within PyTorch. Torch Tool provides advanced device handling, seamless fallback mechanisms, automatic mixed precision (AMP), memory management, telemetry, and easy tensorizationâ€”without sacrificing transparency or control.

## Main Features
- Automatic device selection and management for CUDA, CPU, and future accelerators (XPU/MPS/AMD).
- Seamless GPU-to-CPU fallback on CUDA out-of-memory (OOM) events.
- Advanced mixed precision (AMP) contexts (`autocast`, `grad_scaler`).
- Transparent tensor conversion from raw Python types, NumPy arrays, and TensorFlow tensors.
- Retry and timeout management for robust, fault-tolerant execution.
- Real-time telemetry and debugging dashboards.
- Compatibility-focused design suitable for PyTorch core integration.

Torch Tool enhances PyTorch workflows by reducing repetitive code, ensuring robustness, and offering transparent and easy-to-debug utilities suitable for both research and production environments.
